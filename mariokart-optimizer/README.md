# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Setup Optimizer

This is a simple React web app that helps you find optimal combinations of characters, vehicles, and tires in **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe**.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the directory with a static web server such as `python -m http.server`. No build step is required because the page pulls React, ReactDOM, Babel, Tailwind, and Lucide from public CDNs.

## Creating a GitHub repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example, `mariokart-optimizer`).
2. Copy the contents of this `mariokart-optimizer` folder into the repository root.
3. Commit the files and push them to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Pages (using the `main` branch) if you want to host the app online. The app will be available at the URL provided by GitHub Pages.
